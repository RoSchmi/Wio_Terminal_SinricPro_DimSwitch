# Wio_Terminal_SinricPro_DimSwitch

This is a modification of this hackster contribution for the Wio Terminal

### WioTerminal-IoTs-Dimmer
https://www.hackster.io/SeeedStudio/wioterminal-iots-dimmer-a106b9


The application is modified to be easily compiled on PlatformIO IDE

The SinricPro_Generic and WebSockets_Generic libraries are not installed through lib_deps
They are installed directly in the lib folder, otherwise there were many compiler errors which couldn't be resolved easily
